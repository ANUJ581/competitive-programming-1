Compilation of all the programs for practice and contests.

Under the codebook package, you will find Java, C++, and pseudocode implementations of useful
algorithms, theorems, and paradigms. If a program is describing an algorithm paradigm, there is
usually a reference problem to help explain the method. (E.G. <a href =
"https://github.com/jeffrey-xiao/Competitive-Programming/blob/master/src/codebook/algorithms/CentroidDecomposition.cpp"
target = "blank">IOI 2011 Race</a> is used to explain centroid decomposition).

Under the contest package, you will find my Java and C++ solutions to various programming contests
and practice problems. The solutions are oganized by the origin of the problem (E.G. CCC, USACO,
COCI, Codeforces, Topcoder, Hackerrank).
