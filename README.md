# Competitive-Programming
Compilation of all the programs for practice and contests	

Under the codebook package, you will find Java, C++, and pseudocode implementations of useful algorithms, theorems, and paradigms. If a program is describing an algorithm paradigm, there is usually a reference problem to help explain the method. (E.G. [IOI 2011 Race](/codebook/algorithms/CentroidDecomposition.cpp) is used to explain centroid decomposition.

Under the contest package, you will find my Java and C++ solutions to various programming contests and practice problems. The solutions are oganized by the origin of the problem (E.G. CCC, USACO, COCI, Codeforces, Topcoder, Hackerrank).
